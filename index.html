    <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement has brought the code aspect of a website to three seprate layers when building a website.
    Since there is three seprate sections to Writing a website the builder can clean up his or her code alowwing it 
    to be more understandable. It also alows users from many diffrent platforms and screens to view the content. Here is 
a link to a article that I found about <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">(Progressive Enhancement).</a></p>
    <h2>DRAGON PROJECT REVISION AND REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT (FINAL)</h2>
        <p>For my First try at the dragon project I had my friend Blade look over the website and had him give me 
        feedback. Some of the feedack that I recived was that my website looked bland and two dark. One last thing 
        that he pointed out was how my font was also too small. After removing the black bacground I used a white 
        and grey background I think that it made the website easier to read and does look better. Things that I have 
        have learned from this project are that I should work one step at a time and not try to work on several pages
        at once. I think that I got caught up on how the website should looked before I needed too. From the begining 
        of the class I had no idea what HTML really was or how it worked. I really enjoyed the class as you have taught 
        me alot from day one.</p>
