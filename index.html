  <h1>Gordo (monkey)</h1>
<p>
  Gordo was one of the first monkeys to travel into space. As part of the NASA space program, Gordo, also known as Old Reliable, 
  was launched from Cape Canaveral on December 13, 1958, in the U.S. PGM-19 Jupiter rocket on its AM-13 mission. The rocket would 
  travel over 1,500 miles and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic. 
  A technical malfunction prevented the capsule's parachute from opening and, despite a short search, neither his body nor the vessel 
  were ever recovered.[1]
